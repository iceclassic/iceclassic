## Scope
Given that we are building this book from scratch we have a few options regarding the scope/objective

```{admonition} Integration with MUDE 
:class: dropdown
 We develop the textbook in a 1-to-1 correspondence with the MUDE Textbook/schedule. Applying the concept of that week in  the ice classic setting/framework.

 We can integrate the challenge as part of either the individual assignment or through the group project.
```

```{admonition} MUDE Sidequest
:class: dropdown
Similar to the option before, but as the title implies,  MUDE adjacent in the sense that we do not directly reference the weekly MUDE schedule, but we use the book as way to show how can we apply the MUDE concepts to a complex problem.
```

```{admonition} Collaborative Notebook
:class: dropdown 
We can set up the notebook as basically a very detail README/ Example page for the repo. This notebook would be the starting page for anyone that wants to get involve ( or simply curious) with the ICE Challenge.
Probable start as a CEG effort and then, expand to other faculties/groups.
